We were on a very tight deadline to produce the promotional material, ready for a launch party the following week. Henri was incredibly accommodating, and made himself available for the following day The photographs were excellent and met with the client’s approval, so much so that he also became the photographer for the launch event! Henri is highly personable and professional and I have no hesitation in recommending him.",
